# On Adapting Nesterov's Scheme to Accelerate Iterative Methods for Linear Problems

Tao Hong and Irad Yavneh, ``On Adapting Nesterovâ€™s Scheme to Accelerate Iterative Methods for Linear Problem'', Accepted to Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications, 2021.

In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution to decide the optimal parameter inside Nesterov's scheme when the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix are real and the smallest and largest eigenvalues are given. Moreover, we show a sufficient condition which explicitly depicts a complex domain that the optimal parameter obtained through the smallest and largest real eigenvalues are still optimal when the iteration matrix has complex eigenvlaues.
