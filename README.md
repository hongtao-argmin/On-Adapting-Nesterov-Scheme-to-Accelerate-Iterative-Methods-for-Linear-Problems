[Tao Hong](https://hongtao.cswp.cs.technion.ac.il) and [Irad Yavneh](https://irad.cs.technion.ac.il), ``[On Adapting Nesterovâ€™s Scheme to Accelerate Iterative Methods for Linear Problem](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/nla.2417)'', Accepted to Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications, 2021.

In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution to decide the optimal parameter inside Nesterov's scheme when the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix are real and the smallest and largest eigenvalues are given. Moreover, we show a sufficient condition which explicitly depicts a complex domain that the optimal parameter obtained through the smallest and largest real eigenvalues are still optimal when the iteration matrix has complex eigenvlaues.
