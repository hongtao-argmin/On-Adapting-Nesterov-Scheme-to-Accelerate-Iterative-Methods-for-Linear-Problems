# On Adapting Nesterov's Scheme to Accelerate Iterative Methods for Linear Problems -- To appear in Numerical Linear Algebra with Applications

In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution to decide the optimal parameter inside Nesterov's scheme when the eigenvalues of the corresponding iteration matrix are real and the smallest and largest eigenvalues are given. Moreover, we show a sufficient condition which explicitly depicts a complex domain that the optimal parameter obtained through the smallest and largest real eigenvalues are still optimal even the iteration matrix has complex eigenvlaues.
